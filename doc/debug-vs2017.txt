Debugging zcoin code using Visual Studio 2017
---------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
1. Windows 10 x64
2. WSL/Ubuntu installed (go to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide to learn how)
3. Visual Studio 2017 (Community Edition is enough, Desktop development with C++ workload should be installed,
   Linux development option is recommended)
4. (optional) VisualGDB (install trial version from here https://visualgdb.com/download/)


Building

 1. Launch Ubuntu shell (search for Bash in the "Type here to search" box)

 2. Upgrade outdated packages. This applies even if you just installed WSL.
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
      sudo apt-get autoremove

 3. Install build tools
      sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils git

 3. WSL filesystem is accessible from the rest of Windows world through directory
      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\lxss
         (if installed by lxrun /install)
    or app directory looking something like this (can be different on your machine)
      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs
         (if installed through Windows Store)
    It is generally OK to read these files from generic Windows app but Unix file permissions are stored in extended
    attributes which are not properly updated by usual applications. For example if you create a file/directory inside
    WSL subsystem from Explorer it won't be visible by WSL program.

    To share files between two worlds we need to create a directory for repository in your Windows home directory
    and then create a link from the WSL to it.

    From Explorer create a directory named
      C:\Users\<username>\zcoin
    From Ubuntu bash window create a link to it
      ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<username>/zcoin zcoin 

 4. Clone git resository into newly created directory and go to the right branch
      git clone https://github.com/zcoinofficial/zcoin.git
      cd zcoin
      git checkout core_upgrade
    Configure git to always use LF and (optionally) specify your name/email. Global Windows git settings (if set)
    won't be inherited if git is invoked from Ubuntu shell
      git config core.autocrlf input
      git config user.name "Your Name"
      git config user.email "your.email"

 5. Install cross-compilation tools
      sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-i686 mingw-w64-i686-dev g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev curl

 6. Build fails when there are special symbols (space, parentheses etc) in path directories. Reset path to the simple 
    one
      export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

    Also if WSL interop is enabled some parts might not get configured for cross-compilation and will ultimately fail.
    Disable it for the WSL session:
      sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop'

 7. Dependencies won't compile in a directory shared with Windows. We need to copy everything to the space private to
    WSL. Do not use .. here as it will lead you into different directory
      cp -r depends ~/zcoin-depends

 8. Go to depends folder and build dependencies (you may wish to build only 32-bit or 64-bit version)
      cd ~/zcoin-depends
      make HOST=i686-w64-mingw32 -j4
      make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -j4
      cd ~/zcoin
    It takes a while. You need to do it only once unless you delete zcoin-depends directory

 9. Generate configure script
      ./autogen.sh
    Now do either step 10 or step 11, not both. Add -Wno-deprecated-declarations to CXXFLAGS if you want to reduce
    nonessential output

10. Build 32-bit debug build (from the zcoin root directory)
      make clean
      ./configure --enable-debug --disable-hardening --disable-gcc-hardening --disable-linker-hardening --prefix=$HOME/zcoin-depends/i686-w64-mingw32
      make -j4
     
11. Build 64-bit debug build (from the zcoin root directory)
      make clean
      ./configure "CXXFLAGS=-Og -g" "CFLAGS=-Og -g" LDFLAGS=-g --disable-hardening --disable-gcc-hardening --disable-linker-hardening --prefix=$HOME/zcoin-depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32
      make -j4
    Note that --enable-debug won't work here because of buggy mingw toolchain

    If you want to compile release build replace ./configure command in steps 10 and 11 with these commands for
    32-bit and 64-bit respectively
      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zcoin-depends/i686-w64-mingw32
      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zcoin-depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32


Preparations for debugging

  Visual Studio output window doesn't support UTF-8 encodind so we need to enable default 8-bit encoding in the
  WSL subsystem
    sudo sed -Ei 's/^#[[:space:]]+(en_US.ISO-8859-15.*)/\1/' /etc/locale.gen
    sudo locale-gen

  There are two options here. One involves using Visual Studio as a debugger only. It doesn't require any paid addons.
  If you want to use Visual Studio as a fully fledged IDE for developing you'd want to go with non-free VisualGDB
  plugin.


Free option

1. Install MinGW from here: http://www.msys2.org/
   Download edition with the same bitness as your build. Then run it and update the package to the most recent
   version
     pacman -Suy
   Do as told. Run the update again
     pacman -Suy
   Install gdb
     pacman -S gdb
 
2. Create a new project with Visual Studio. Select "General\Makefile project" as a project type (DO NOT create a
   cross-platform Linux project).
     Name: zcoin
     Location: C:\Users\<username>\zcoin
     Solution: Create new solution
     Solution name: vsdebug

   Then
     Build command line: C:\Windows\SysNative\bash.exe -c "LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-15 make -C ~/zcoin -j4"
     Clean command line: C:\Windows\SysNative\bash.exe -c "LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-15 make -C ~/zcoin clean"

   Now you can build and clean the project from within Visual Studio

3. Create an XML file C:\Users\<username>\zcoin\vsdebug\debug.xml
   Replace all the paths with actual ones, adjust architecture if needed, set executable you want to debug and set
   needed arguments for the program

     <PipeLaunchOptions xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vstudio/MDDDebuggerOptions/2014" 
        PipePath="C:\msys64\usr\bin\gdb.exe" 
        PipeArguments="--interpreter=mi" 
        ExePath="C:/Users/<username>/zcoin/src/zcoind.exe" ExeArguments="" 
        TargetArchitecture="X64" 
        WorkingDirectory="C:/Users/<username>/zcoin" 
        AdditionalSOLibSearchPath=""> 
     </PipeLaunchOptions>

4. If you need to set a breakpoint before you launch debugger just open the source file (normal File\Open) and set
   it there

5. To launch a debugger you have to go to Command Window (View\Other Windows\Command Window) and issue a command
     Debug.MIDebugLaunch /Executable:zcoin /OptionsFile:"C:\Users\<username>\zcoin\vsdebug\debug.xml"


VisualGDB

1. Launch Visual Studio 2017. If you installed VisualGDB there will be "Debug\Quick Debug with GDB" menu item. Choose it.
   Select Taget="MinGW/Cygwin", Debugged program is "src\zcoin-cli.exe" in the directory mentioned above

   GDB toolchain is either MinGW32 or MinGW64 depending on how you built the code

2. Click on "Debug", you'll break on main() function, have fun
