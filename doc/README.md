# Firo Core
*Note: some of the documents in this repository might still refer to Bitcoin*

## Setup

[Firo Core] (https://firo.org/get-firo/download/) is the original Firo client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Firo transactions (which is currently several hundreds MBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.


## Building

The following are developer notes on how to build Firo on your native platform. They are not complete guides, but include notes on the necessary libraries, compile flags, etc.
